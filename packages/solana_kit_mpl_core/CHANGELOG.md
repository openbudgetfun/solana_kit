## [0.9.1](https://github.com/openbudgetfun/solana_kit/releases/tag/v0.9.1) (2026-08-30)

### 🐛 Fixed

#### Fix publish validation for ecosystem packages

Declare the `meta` and `solana_kit_accounts` dependencies that the generated Squads and mpl-token-metadata clients import, so `dart pub publish` validation passes, and normalize `readme.md` to `README.md` across the ecosystem packages to satisfy the pub README requirement.
