## wallet [0.1.0](https://github.com/openbudgetfun/solana_kit/releases/tag/wallet/v0.1.0) (2026-08-30)

### 💥 Breaking Change

#### Add cross-platform Flutter wallet support

Add Wallet Standard contracts, browser discovery, Android Mobile Wallet Adapter support, Solana Kit signer integration, and responsive Material, Cupertino, and adaptive wallet UI. Applications can use the default interface, customize its theme and builders, or bring entirely custom widgets.

```dart
final registry = createDefaultWalletRegistry(
  appIdentity: const WalletAppIdentity(name: 'My app'),
  chain: SolanaChainId.mainnet,
);
final controller = WalletController(registry);
await controller.initialize();
```
