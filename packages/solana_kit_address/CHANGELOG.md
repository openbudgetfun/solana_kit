### 💥 Breaking Change

#### new `solana_kit_address` package

Initial release of `solana_kit_address` — core Address extension type, codecs, comparator, and PublicKey type extracted from `solana_kit_addresses`.

```dart
import 'package:solana_kit_address/solana_kit_address.dart';

final address = Address('11111111111111111111111111111111');
final codec = Address.codec();
```

### 🐛 Fixed

#### Add well-known program, sysvar, SPL, Metaplex, and token mint address constants

Add centralized address constants to `solana_kit_addresses` so that any package can reference well-known on-chain addresses without importing the full domain package or hardcoding strings.

New exports:

- `program_addresses.dart` — All Agave/Solana native program addresses (system, ALT, BPF loaders, compute budget, config, stake, vote, etc.)
- `sysvar_addresses.dart` — All sysvar addresses (clock, rent, recentBlockhashes, fees, rewards, etc.) plus the sysvar owner address
- `spl_addresses.dart` — SPL program addresses (Token, Token-2022, ATA, Memo, Memo Legacy)
- `metaplex_addresses.dart` — Metaplex program addresses (Token Metadata, Bubblegum, Auth Rules, Core, SPL Account Compression, Noop)
- `well_known_addresses.dart` — Well-known token mint addresses (Wrapped SOL, USDC, USDT)

Also re-exports from `solana_kit_address` (Address type, codecs, comparator, PublicKey) and `solana_kit_address_constants` (well-known address constants).
